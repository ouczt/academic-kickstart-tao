abstract="Gastrointestinal mucositis and infection by chemotherapy treatment are associated with alterations in the functioning of the intestinal barrier, due to the potential damage induced by anticancer drugs on the epithelial tight junctions and adheren junction. We aimed to study the protective effect of dietary polysaccharides on chemotherapy-induced injury in the epithelial cells. In the current study, using mice that were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide for 2 days, we reveal that polysaccharides from the ink of Ommastrephes bartrami (OBP) enhanced the mRNA and protein expression levels of Occludin, zonulae occluden (ZO)-1, and E-cadherin. Immunohistochemistry staining of ZO-1 and E-cadherin confirmed the increase in the mRNA and protein levels. OBP also remarkably enhanced the mRNA expression of other tight junction proteins, ZO-2, ZO-3, claudin-2, and cingulin. Our results may have important implications in host defense, especially the immunopotentiation function of OBP on the cyclophosphamide-induced epithelial cell injury, as well as intestinal disorders involving inflammation and infection."
